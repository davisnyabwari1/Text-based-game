	TEXT BASED ADVENTURE GAME
As the name suggests it is a game built based on text only.Its a form of a game that is built with python.
Basically i built this game on my beginner level to test my skills on different skills such as the use of functions,
loops,use of simple modules and data types.
The game comprises of one player where you are taken to different scenarios based on the decision you make.
